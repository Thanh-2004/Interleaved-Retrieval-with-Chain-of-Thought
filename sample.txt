Question: How does IRCoT improve over traditional RAG approaches and what are its key components?
Answer:
IRCoT improves over traditional RAG (Retrieve-and-Read) approaches by operating through an iterative process that alternates between extending the Chain of Thought (CoT) and expanding retrieved information. This allows for a more dynamic and interactive process, where each retrieved piece of information influences the next thought step, and each reasoning step guides subsequent retrieval actions.

The key components of the IRCoT process include:

1. Query understanding and decomposition
2. Initial document retrieval
3. Iterative reasoning steps
IRCoT (Interleaved Retrieval and Chain-of-Thought) improves over traditional RAG (Retrieve-and-Read) approaches in several ways. The key differences and components are as follows:

**Improvements over Traditional RAG:**

1. **Iterative process**: IRCoT operates through an iterative process that alternates between extending the Chain of Thought (CoT) and expanding retrieved information. This allows for a more dynamic and interactive process.
2. **Dynamic interplay**: Each
